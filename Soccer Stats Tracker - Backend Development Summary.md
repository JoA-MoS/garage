## 🗄️ Database Schema (TypeORM Entities Designed)

### **Core Entities Ready for Implementation**

```typescript
// Main game entities
-GameEntity(id, startTime, homeTeamId, awayTeamId, status, duration) -
  TeamEntity(id, name, gameId, formation) -
  PlayerEntity(id, name, jersey, teamId, position, isActive) -
  // Statistics entities
  GoalEntity(id, gameId, teamId, scorerId, assistId, minute, timestamp) -
  GameParticipationEntity(playerId, gameId, startMinute, endMinute, isStarter) -
  SubstitutionEntity(id, gameId, playerOutId, playerInId, minute, reason) -
  // Advanced analytics entities
  SeasonEntity(id, name, startDate, endDate) -
  LeagueEntity(id, name, seasonId, format) -
  GameStatsEntity(gameId, playerId, goals, assists, minutesPlayed);
```

### **Relationships Mapped**

- **Game** → hasMany Teams, Goals, Substitutions, Participations
- **Team** → hasMany Players, belongsTo Game
- **Player** → belongsTo Team, hasMany Goals (as scorer), hasMany Goals (as assist)
- **Goal** → belongsTo Game, Team, Player (scorer), Player (assist)

## 📊 Data Models & Types

### **Current Frontend Types**

```typescript
interface Player {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  jersey: number;
  position: string;
  depthRank: number;
  playTime: number;
  isOnField: boolean;
}

interface Goal {
  id: string;
  timestamp: number; // Game time in seconds
  scorerId: number; // Player who scored
  assistId?: number; // Player who assisted
  realTime: string; // Actual timestamp
}

interface Team {
  name: string;
  players: Player[];
  goals: Goal[];
}

interface GameConfig {
  playersPerTeam: number;
  playersOnField: number;
  positions: string[];
  homeTeamName: string;
  awayTeamName: string;
}
```

## 🎮 Test Data Available

### **Pre-populated Teams (4 Formats)**

1. **11v11**: FC Barcelona vs Real Madrid (realistic player names, positions)
2. **9v9**: Eagles FC vs Lions United (youth format, 3-3-2 formation)
3. **7v7**: Sharks FC vs Tigers Academy (youth format, 2-3-1 formation)
4. **5v5**: City FC vs United FC (small-sided games)

### **Test Data Features**

- ✅ Realistic player names and jersey numbers
- ✅ Proper formations for each format
- ✅ Depth chart rankings (starters vs substitutes)
- ✅ One-click loading via colored buttons in UI

## 🔧 Technical Architecture

### **Service Layer Pattern**

```typescript
// Current frontend services (ready for backend migration)
GameStatsService; // Basic stats (goals, assists, team scores)
AdvancedStatsService; // Complex analytics (season stats, trends)
PlayTimeTrackingService; // Time management (minutes, substitutions)
```

### **Component Architecture**

```typescript
// Smart Components (handle data & business logic)
PlayerCard; // Player stats display
StatsTab; // Game statistics
ConfigTab; // Game setup

// Dumb Components (pure presentation)
PlayerCardPresentation; // Player UI only
GameHeader; // Score display
GoalModal; // Goal entry form
```

## 🚀 Ready for Backend Implementation

### **What Needs to be Built**

1. **NestJS Application** with GraphQL API
2. **TypeORM Integration** with PostgreSQL/MySQL
3. **Database Migrations** using existing entity designs
4. **GraphQL Schema** matching frontend types
5. **Real-time Subscriptions** for live updates
6. **Authentication/Authorization** for multi-user games

### **Migration Strategy**

- **Frontend service calls** → **GraphQL queries/mutations**
- **Current types** → **Database entities** (already designed)
- **In-memory state** → **Database persistence**
- **Local updates** → **WebSocket subscriptions**

### **API Endpoints Needed**

```graphql
# Queries
games: [Game!]!
game(id: ID!): Game
players(teamId: ID!): [Player!]!
gameStats(gameId: ID!): GameStats!

# Mutations
createGame(input: CreateGameInput!): Game!
addGoal(input: AddGoalInput!): Goal!
substitutePlayer(input: SubstitutionInput!): Substitution!
updateGameTime(gameId: ID!, time: Int!): Game!

# Subscriptions
gameUpdated(gameId: ID!): Game!
goalScored(gameId: ID!): Goal!
substitutionMade(gameId: ID!): Substitution!
```
