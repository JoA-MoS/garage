# Soccer Stats Tracker - Project Summary

## 🎯 What We Built

A comprehensive **React Native/Expo-compatible soccer game stats tracking app** with intelligent substitution management, designed for coaches and team managers.

## ✅ Key Features Implemented

### **Game Configuration System**

- **Customizable team settings**: Team name, total players (6-30), players on field
- **Dynamic position management**: Add/remove/edit positions (default: Goalkeeper, Defender, Midfielder, Forward)
- **Smart player generation**: Automatically creates players based on configuration
- **Real-time preview**: Shows configuration summary before starting game

### **Score Tracking & Goal Recording**

- **Home vs Away scoreboard**: Large, prominent score display
- **Goal recording modal**: Select scorer and optional assist from active players
- **Automatic stat updates**: Player goals/assists sync with team score

### **Game Timer & Player Management**

- **Real-time game clock**: Start/pause functionality with live timer
- **Automatic play time tracking**: Tracks individual player minutes on field
- **Visual lineup display**: Separate views for players on field vs bench
- **Quick stat buttons**: Add goals/assists directly from player cards

### **Intelligent Substitution System**

- **Smart recommendations**: AI-powered suggestions based on:
  - Play time equity (rest tired players)
  - Depth chart rankings (give opportunities to bench players)
  - Position-specific matching
- **Manual substitution interface**: Easy drag-and-drop style management
- **Substitution history**: Tracks all changes with timestamps

### **Statistics Dashboard**

- **Team totals**: Goals, assists, average play time
- **Player statistics table**: Complete individual performance data
- **Real-time updates**: All stats update live during game

## 🔧 Technical Architecture

### **For Nx Monorepo Integration**

```
apps/
├── mobile-app/          # React Native/Expo
└── web-app/            # React web app

libs/
├── shared-ui/          # Common components and design system
├── game-logic/         # Core business logic for stats and substitutions
├── data-models/        # TypeScript interfaces and types
└── utils/              # Shared utilities and helpers
```

### **Code Structure**

- **Configuration state management**: Separate from game state
- **Component separation**: ConfigTab extracted for performance
- **Smart re-rendering**: Only regenerates players when structural changes occur
- **Cross-platform compatibility**: Uses Expo framework for web + mobile

## 🐛 Critical Issues Fixed

### **Input Focus Problem** ⭐ MAJOR FIX

- **Issue**: All configuration input fields lost focus after typing one character
- **Root cause**: ConfigTab component was redefined on every render
- **Solution**: Moved ConfigTab outside main component, passed props down
- **Result**: All inputs now maintain focus and work normally

### **Template Literal Syntax Errors**

- **Issue**: Template literal backticks causing parse errors
- **Solution**: Converted all template literals to string concatenation
- **Result**: Code runs without syntax errors

## 📁 Files for VS Code

### **Main Component File**

```
src/components/SoccerStatsTracker.jsx
```

Contains the complete working React component with all features.

### **Test Files**

```
tests/soccer-stats-tracker.spec.js
```

Comprehensive Playwright test suite covering:

- Configuration input testing (including focus retention)
- Game functionality
- Substitution system
- Accessibility and responsive design

## 🚀 Next Steps for VS Code

1. **Create Nx workspace structure**

   ```bash
   npx create-nx-workspace@latest soccer-stats --preset=react-native
   ```

2. **Extract shared libraries**:

   - Move game logic to `libs/game-logic`
   - Move data models to `libs/data-models`
   - Create shared UI components

3. **Add TypeScript interfaces**

   ```typescript
   interface Player {
     id: number;
     name: string;
     jersey: number;
     position: string;
     depthRank: number;
     playTime: number;
     isOnField: boolean;
     goals: number;
     assists: number;
   }

   interface GameConfig {
     playersPerTeam: number;
     playersOnField: number;
     positions: string[];
     teamName: string;
   }
   ```

4. **Implement data persistence**

   - Local storage for game state
   - Export game reports
   - Season statistics tracking

5. **Add opponent team tracking**

   - Two-team mode
   - Head-to-head statistics

6. **Enhance substitution recommendations**
   - Player fatigue modeling
   - Performance-based suggestions
   - Formation-aware substitutions

## 💡 Key Technical Insights

- **React performance**: Component definition location matters for re-rendering
- **State management**: Separate UI state from business logic state
- **Cross-platform**: Expo enables easy web + mobile deployment
- **Testing**: Playwright provides comprehensive E2E testing capabilities

## 🧪 Testing Setup

### **Install Playwright**

```bash
npm install -D @playwright/test
npx playwright install
```

### **Run Tests**

```bash
# Run all tests
npx playwright test

# Run with UI
npx playwright test --ui

# Run specific test
npx playwright test --grep "should allow typing in team name field"

# Run in headed mode (see browser)
npx playwright test --headed
```

### **Critical Test for Focus Issue**

```javascript
test('should allow typing in team name field without losing focus', async ({ page }) => {
  const teamNameInput = page.locator('input[placeholder="Enter team name"]');

  await teamNameInput.clear();
  await teamNameInput.type('Test Team Name', { delay: 50 });

  // This will fail if input loses focus
  await expect(teamNameInput).toBeFocused();
  await expect(teamNameInput).toHaveValue('Test Team Name');
});
```

## 📱 App Flow

```
Configuration Screen
       ↓
   [Start Game]
       ↓
   Game Screen
   ├── Score Display (Home vs Away)
   ├── Game Timer (Start/Pause)
   ├── Navigation Tabs:
   │   ├── Lineup (Players on field/bench)
   │   ├── Stats (Team totals, player table)
   │   └── Substitutions (Smart recommendations)
   └── [New Game] → Back to Configuration
```

## ⚡ Performance Optimizations

- **Conditional player regeneration**: Only when structural config changes
- **Stable component references**: Prevents unnecessary re-renders
- **Efficient state updates**: Minimizes React render cycles
- **Memory management**: Proper cleanup of timers and intervals

---

**The app is now fully functional and ready for development in VS Code with proper input handling, intelligent features, and comprehensive test coverage!**
