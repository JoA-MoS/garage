# Entity Migration Summary

This document outlines the changes made to migrate from the original entity structure to the new event-based, many-to-many relationship design.

## ðŸŽ¯ Migration Overview

### Key Changes:

1. **Many-to-Many Relationships**: Teams â†” Games and Teams â†” Players
2. **Event-Based System**: Unified `GameEvent` entity replaces `Goal` and `Substitution`
3. **Junction Tables**: Added `GameTeam` and `TeamPlayer` entities
4. **Event Types**: Added `EventType` reference table for extensible event management

## ðŸ“Š New Entity Structure

### Core Entities

- âœ… **Game** - Updated (removed team names, added gameTeams/gameEvents relationships)
- âœ… **Team** - Updated (removed game relationship, added many-to-many relationships)
- âœ… **Player** - Updated (removed team relationship, added many-to-many relationships)

### Junction Tables

- âœ… **GameTeam** - NEW (links Games â†” Teams, stores home/away, formation)
- âœ… **TeamPlayer** - NEW (links Teams â†” Players, stores jersey, depth rank)

### Event System

- âœ… **EventType** - NEW (reference table for event definitions)
- âœ… **GameEvent** - NEW (unified event system replaces Goal/Substitution)

### Updated Entities

- âœ… **GameParticipation** - Updated (added gameTeamId relationship)

## ðŸ†• New Entities Detail

### GameTeam (Junction Table)

```typescript
{
  id: string (UUID)
  isHome: boolean          // From Team entity
  formation?: string       // From Team entity
  gameId: string
  teamId: string
  game: Game              // ManyToOne
  team: Team              // ManyToOne
  gameEvents: GameEvent[] // OneToMany
  gameParticipations: GameParticipation[] // OneToMany
}
```

### TeamPlayer (Junction Table)

```typescript
{
  id: string (UUID)
  jersey: number          // From Player entity
  depthRank: number       // From Player entity
  isActive: boolean       // From Player entity
  joinedAt: Date
  leftAt?: Date
  teamId: string
  playerId: string
  team: Team              // ManyToOne
  player: Player          // ManyToOne
}
```

### EventType (Reference Table)

```typescript
{
  id: string (UUID)
  code: string (unique)   // 'GOAL', 'YELLOW_CARD', etc.
  name: string           // 'Goal', 'Yellow Card', etc.
  description?: string
  category: EventCategory // SCORING, DISCIPLINE, etc.
  requiresRelatedPlayer: boolean
  isTeamEvent: boolean
  isPositive: boolean
  metadataSchema?: object // JSON schema for validation
  isActive: boolean
  gameEvents: GameEvent[] // OneToMany
}
```

### GameEvent (Unified Event System)

```typescript
{
  id: string (UUID)
  minute: number
  timestamp: number       // Game time in seconds
  realTime: Date         // Actual timestamp
  notes?: string
  metadata?: object      // Event-specific data
  eventTypeId: string
  gameId: string
  gameTeamId: string
  playerId: string
  relatedPlayerId?: string // For assists, substitutions, fouls
  eventType: EventType    // ManyToOne
  game: Game             // ManyToOne
  gameTeam: GameTeam     // ManyToOne
  player: Player         // ManyToOne
  relatedPlayer?: Player // ManyToOne
}
```

## ðŸš€ Benefits of New Design

### 1. **Real-World Flexibility**

- Teams can play multiple games across seasons
- Players can transfer between teams
- Complete history of player-team relationships

### 2. **Event System Advantages**

- Single table for all game events
- Easy to add new event types (VAR, injuries, etc.)
- Unified timeline and analytics
- Consistent event structure

### 3. **Better Data Integrity**

- Foreign key constraints ensure valid relationships
- Event types prevent invalid event data
- Junction tables eliminate data redundancy

### 4. **Improved Performance**

- Single event table for timeline queries
- Reduced JOIN complexity for event data
- Better indexing strategies

### 5. **Enhanced Analytics**

- Cross-team player performance tracking
- Historical team composition analysis
- Event pattern recognition
- Real-time game feeds

## ðŸ“‹ Migration Checklist

### Database Migration Required:

- [ ] Create new tables: `event_types`, `game_teams`, `team_players`, `game_events`
- [ ] Migrate existing data from `goals` and `substitutions` to `game_events`
- [ ] Update `game_participations` to include `game_team_id`
- [ ] Remove columns from `games`: `home_team_name`, `away_team_name`
- [ ] Remove columns from `teams`: `formation`, `is_home`, `game_id`
- [ ] Remove columns from `players`: `jersey`, `depth_rank`, `is_on_field`, `is_active`, `team_id`
- [ ] Populate `event_types` with seed data
- [ ] Create appropriate indexes

### Application Updates Required:

- [ ] Update GraphQL resolvers for new relationships
- [ ] Update services to use event-based queries
- [ ] Update mutations to create GameEvent records
- [ ] Update UI components for new data structure
- [ ] Add event type management interfaces

### Testing Required:

- [ ] Unit tests for new entities
- [ ] Integration tests for new relationships
- [ ] Migration script testing
- [ ] GraphQL schema validation
- [ ] Performance testing for event queries
