# Games Module Update Summary

## ✅ **Updated Components:**

### **1. GamesModule (`games.module.ts`)**

**Updated imports:**

- ❌ Removed: `Goal`, `Substitution`
- ✅ Added: `GameTeam`, `TeamPlayer`, `EventType`, `GameEvent`

### **2. CreateGameInput (`dto/create-game.input.ts`)**

**Changed structure:**

- ❌ Removed: `homeTeamName: string`, `awayTeamName: string`
- ✅ Added: `homeTeamId: string`, `awayTeamId: string`

**Benefits:**

- Now references existing teams instead of creating new ones
- Supports the many-to-many Game ↔ Team relationship
- Better data integrity with foreign key constraints

### **3. GamesService (`games.service.ts`)**

**Updated dependencies:**

- ✅ Added: `GameTeam` repository injection

**Updated methods:**

- **`findAll()`** & **`findOne()`**: Updated relations to use new entity structure

  - `gameTeams.team.teamPlayers.player` (instead of `teams.players`)
  - `gameEvents.eventType.player` (instead of `goals.scorer`)
  - `participations.gameTeam` (added gameTeam context)

- **`create()`**: Complete rewrite for new structure
  - ✅ Validates that both teams exist before creating game
  - ✅ Creates `GameTeam` relationships instead of creating new teams
  - ✅ Properly sets `isHome` flag on the relationship

**Error handling:**

- ✅ Added validation for non-existent team IDs
- ✅ Better error messages with specific team ID references

### **4. GamesResolver (`games.resolver.ts`)**

- ✅ **No changes needed** - continues to work with updated service

## 🗑️ **Legacy Entities Ready for Deletion:**

### **Safe to Delete:**

1. **`goal.entity.ts`** - Replaced by `GameEvent` with `eventType: 'GOAL'`
2. **`substitution.entity.ts`** - Replaced by `GameEvent` with `eventType: 'SUBSTITUTION_OUT/IN'`

### **Verification:**

- ✅ Not imported in any active modules
- ✅ Not referenced in app configuration
- ✅ Not used in any services or resolvers
- ✅ Only exported in `index.ts` (marked as legacy)

## 🔄 **Migration Impact:**

### **API Changes:**

```graphql
# OLD - Create game with team names
mutation CreateGame {
  createGame(createGameInput: { homeTeamName: "Team A", awayTeamName: "Team B", format: ELEVEN_V_ELEVEN }) {
    id
    homeTeamName
    awayTeamName
  }
}

# NEW - Create game with existing team IDs
mutation CreateGame {
  createGame(createGameInput: { homeTeamId: "uuid-team-a", awayTeamId: "uuid-team-b", format: ELEVEN_V_ELEVEN }) {
    id
    gameTeams {
      isHome
      team {
        name
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### **Database Schema Changes:**

- ✅ `games` table: Removed `home_team_name`, `away_team_name` columns
- ✅ `game_teams` table: Added for Game ↔ Team relationships
- ✅ `team_players` table: Added for Team ↔ Player relationships
- ✅ `event_types` table: Added for event type definitions
- ✅ `game_events` table: Added to replace `goals` and `substitutions`

### **Query Structure Changes:**

```graphql
# OLD structure
{
  games {
    homeTeamName
    awayTeamName
    teams {
      players {
        name
      }
    }
    goals {
      scorer {
        name
      }
    }
  }
}

# NEW structure
{
  games {
    gameTeams {
      isHome
      team {
        name
        teamPlayers {
          player {
            name
          }
        }
      }
    }
    gameEvents {
      eventType {
        code
        name
      }
      player {
        name
      }
    }
  }
}
```

- ✅ Player transfer tracking between teams
- ✅ Game-specific team formations

### **3. Enhanced Analytics:**

- ✅ Cross-game team performance analysis
- ✅ Player performance across different teams
- ✅ Event pattern recognition and statistics
- ✅ Timeline reconstruction from unified events

### **4. Better Data Integrity:**

- ✅ Foreign key constraints prevent orphaned data
- ✅ Event type validation ensures data consistency
- ✅ Junction tables eliminate data redundancy
- ✅ Proper relationship modeling

## 📋 **Next Steps:**
