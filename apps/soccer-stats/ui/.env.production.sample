# Production Environment Variables for Soccer Stats UI
#
# NOTE: Most configuration is now handled automatically:
# - API calls are proxied via Vercel rewrites (see vercel.json)
# - Clerk publishable key is fetched at runtime from /api/config/public
#
# You typically don't need to set any environment variables in Vercel!

# Optional: Override API URL (only needed for non-standard setups)
# In production, Vercel rewrites /api/* to Railway, so this is not needed.
# VITE_API_URL=https://custom-api.example.com

# Optional: Clerk Publishable Key (for debugging only)
# If set, this will bypass the runtime config fetch and use this key directly.
# This is useful for local debugging when you want to connect to a different API.
# In production, leave this unset to use the runtime config from /api/config/public.
